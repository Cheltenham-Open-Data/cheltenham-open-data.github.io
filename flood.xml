      <title>Flood alert: River Windrush from Bourton to Newbridge</title>
      <description>Property flooding is not currently expected. River levels are falling on the River Windrush. However, flooding of low lying land and roads remains possible, especially in areas close to the river around Bourton on the Water. This week is forecast to begin predominantly dry, but more unsettled conditions are expected towards the end of the week. We expect river levels to continue to gradually fall, but levels will be sensitive to further rainfall.
Go to the 'River and Sea levels in England' webpage for current river levels. Avoid using low lying footpaths near local watercourses. This message will be updated on Monday morning, 24/03/25, or as the situation changes.
