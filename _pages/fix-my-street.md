- Daisy Bank Road is a disgrace, chunks of tarmac damage and height drops all the way up tot he car park. I have now lived here for nearly 3 years and nothing has been done about it despite the reporting of the issue. I pay over £300 a month for my CT and am not seeing any value for that let alone a pride in the area covered!! To put it into perspective moving from London where my CT was £85 a month there was far better upkeep and modernising of the area near me., 1st April :- [7368699](https://www.fixmystreet.com/report/7368699)
