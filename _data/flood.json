Flooding of roads and fields is possible. There is no significant rainfall forecast this week. We are not currently expecting very much drop in the groundwater levels. Where groundwater is near the surface, intense rainfall will lead to surface water flooding. Residents are advised to prepare property resilience measures and ensure that pumps are working where they have been installed. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
