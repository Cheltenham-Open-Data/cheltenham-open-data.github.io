The detailed forecast for those that use it is for a peak level at Southend of 3.40mAODN at 12:15pm, on Saturday 29th March, which is 0.22m above tide tables, wind force 4, South Westerly. (mAODN is height above average sea level, for more information refer to local tide tables). The tide on Sunday 30th March at 2pm (British Summer Time) is also currently forecast to be at Flood Alert level. We will send a new message before that tide. Take care on coastal roads and footpaths, and don't put yourself in unnecessary danger. We are monitoring the situation and not expecting the situation to escalate. We will update this message by 4pm on Saturday 29th March. ",

Flooding to homes and businesses is unlikely at this time, but there may be a risk to very low-lying properties or those with basements. River levels in other areas remain below levels of concern. \n\nAvoid using low lying footpaths and any bridges near local watercourses and do not attempt to walk or drive through flood water. We are continuing to monitor the situation.\n\nThis message will be updated by 5pm, Wednesday 2nd April 2025, or as the situation changes.",

Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have reached a level where communities may be affected by groundwater flooding. This week is forecast to begin predominantly dry, but more unsettled conditions are expected towards the end of the week. We expect groundwater levels to remain high for the next few weeks and levels are sensitive to sustained periods of rainfall. Low lying land, roads and properties will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding.
