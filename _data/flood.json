Groundwater levels are above normal for this time of year and have reached a level where communities may be affected by groundwater flooding. This week is forecast to begin predominantly dry, but more unsettled conditions are expected towards the end of the week. We expect groundwater levels to remain high for the next few weeks and levels are sensitive to sustained periods of rainfall. Low lying land, roads and properties will therefore continue to be at risk of flooding. We are continuing to monitor groundwater levels and will update this message next week, by 01/04/2025, or as the situation changes.",
